## Build and install development version of the python binding

**Building the python binding requires python>=3.6**, cmake and Ninja. Ninja and CMake can be installed with pip on Windows and Mac (```pip install cmake ninja```), or using apt-get on Ubuntu/debian (```apt-get install cmake ninja-build```).

The following command builds the binding and register it in development mode (ie. as a link) in python.
